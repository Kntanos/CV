## Who I am
I’m a creator, logical, methodical, I like structure and learning new things. A rather typical introvert with atypical affinity to talking and consciously developed ability to identify my feelings and prod others about theirs.

I trained and worked for 12 years as a Conservation Scientist, eventually leading a team of scientists and conservators that looked after a vast collection of mainly paper-based materials in one of the world's biggest archives. I left that role to pursue a more creative path, but more importantly to do things that excite me, suit better how my brain works and align closer with life circumstances that make me feel content. Coding turns out to be one of those things.

Starting in 2017, I developed a small self-sustained online creative business. I had to learn how to quickly pick up new knowledge and diligently put it into practice. This reignited my interest in software development, so as soon as I had the opportunity to act on it, I did!

In September 2021 I joined the Makers Academy on the 16-week full-time software development course.

## Skills and experience

Makers Academy - 16-week Software Development Bootcapm
Focus on **OOP**, **TDD**, **Agile practices**, **MVC** and **SOLID** principles.

Collaborated with Agile teams with a focus on **XP values**, **pair progamming** and **Git** workflow. 
The final 2-week project was a demonstation of putting Makers' philosophy of 'Learning to learn' in practice, by using a completely unkown stack (MERN) to code a small game.

In the course of the bootcamp I used the following to built web apps:

I mentored 2 junior students at Makers whilst at the bootcamp and afterwards until they graduated. I supported them by sharing insights from my experience during the bootcamp and helping them navigate challenges of working in a team, TDD and finding useful resources.

I volunteer as a coach with [Codebar](https://codebar.io/), an organisation that aims to enable minority group members to learn programming in a safe and collaborative environment. I find seeing the progress of students in the early stage of their coding journey very rewarding and I always learn something new about myself and reinforce my knowledge and understanding of key concepts at every session. 

Years of work experience and creative endeavours have equipped me with a varied set of transferable skills.

* **Keen learner** - When I pick up something new, I will not put it down until I’ve mastered it or at least I exhausted it to the point it succumbs to my will.
 
* **Effective and efficient** - I have managed large projects with multiple stakeholders, deadlines and a team of staff in my previous jobs. Managing resources, including my time, is not something that causes me stress. I have been self-sufficient and motivated throughout change of careers and learning new skills.
 
* **Creative** - I have always maintained a creative outlet and gravitated towards design (I am adept in 3D design and Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator). I approach coding in a similar way to applying design principles to make an aesthetically pleasing art piece. I want my code to be a thing of beauty, even if it is rock, paper, scissors. 
 
* **Problem solving** - I’m analytical. I plan and make a plan B for a plan B. I read instructions and manuals. It means I can be relied on to be self-assured and even-tempered when it is most needed. Attention to detail and imaginative problem solving are not mutually exclusive.
 
* **Communication** - Honesty and openness are paramount to me in all my personal relationships and I have cultivated my communication skills to be constructive and concise. As a conservation scientist I’ve learned to communicate complex and abstract concepts to non-specialists, both to executives and the general public. I have no fear of public speaking and I published academic papers in those days of my career.
