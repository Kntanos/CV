# CV - Kostas Ntanos


## Who I am
Iâ€™m a creator, logical, methodical, I like structure and learning new things. A rather typical introvert with atypical affinity to talking and consciously developed ability to identify my feelings and prod others about theirs.

I trained and worked for 12 years as a Conservation Scientist, eventually leading a team of scientists and conservators that looked after a vast collection of mainly paper-based materials in one of the world's biggest archives. I left that role to pursue a more creative path, but more importantly to do things that excite me, suit better how my brain works and align closer with life circumstances that make me feel content. Coding turns out to be one of these things.

Starting in 2017, I developed a small self-run online creative business. I had to learn how to quickly pick up new knowledge and diligently put it into practice. This reignited my interest in software development, so as soon as I had the opportunity to act on it, I did!

In September 2021 I joined the Makers Academy on the 16-week full-time software development course.

## Skills and experience
Years of work experience and creative endeavours have equipped me with a varied set of transferable skills

* **Keen learner** - When I pick up something new, I will not put it down until Iâ€™ve mastered it or at least I exhausted it to the point it succumbs to my will. From AR filters to computational design.
 
* **Effective and efficient** - I have managed large projects with multiple stakeholders, deadlines and a team of staff in my previous jobs. Managing resources, including my time, is not something that causes me stress. I have been self-sufficient and motivated throughout change of careers and learning new skills.
 
* **Creative** - I have always maintained a creative outlet and gravitated towards design (I am adept in 3D design (Rhinoceros) and Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator). I approach coding in a similar way to applying design principles to make an aesthetically pleasing art piece. I want my code to be a thing of beauty, even if it is rock, paper, scissors. 
 
* **Problem solving** - Iâ€™m analytical. I plan and make a plan B for a plan B. I read instructions and manuals. It may sound boring, but it means I can be relied on to be self-assured and even-tempered when it is most needed. Attention to detail and imaginative problem solving are not mutually exclusive and Iâ€™m very inclusive.
 
* **Communication** - Honesty and openness are paramount to me in all my personal relationships and I have cultivated my communication skills to be constructive and concise. As a conservation scientist Iâ€™ve learned to communicate complex or abstract concepts to non-specialists, both to executives and the general public. I have no fear of public speaking and I have published academic papers in those days.
